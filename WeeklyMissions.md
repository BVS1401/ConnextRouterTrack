# Router Track Missions

Each week there will be some missions for the Router Track participants in which they will be rewarded with some points for delivering that activity.

## How to get maximum points? 

Key evaluation criteria are quality (for docs/ guides/mentoring) and impact (for improvement proposals,  feedback and tools). Connext should aim to be a self served platform also for routers, and we need to make sure documentations and guides serve this purpose.
