# Router Track Missions

Each week there will be some missions for the Router Track participants in which they will be rewarded with some points for delivering that activity.

## How to get maximum points? 

Key evaluation criteria are quality (for docs/ guides/mentoring) and impact (for improvement proposals,  feedback and tools). Connext should aim to be a self served platform also for routers, and we need to make sure documentations and guides serve this purpose.

## ~~Router Track Mission 1 (09.05-16.05)~~

1. Spinning up a router on the testnet (10-30 points that depends on feedback /improvements proposals)
2. Choose the activity which you intend to work on over the course of the program (5 points)
3. Answer questions and help others to run router in this Discord channel (1-10 points)

## ~~Router Track Mission 2 (16.05-23.05)~~

1. Video guide with a step-by-step running router in any language (5-100 points)
2. Guides and your experience articles about running router in socials (medium etc.) in any language (5-50 points)
3. Answer questions and help others to run router in this Discord channel (1-10 points)
4. Feedback/improvement proposals/building high impact tools (5-500 points)

## ~~Router Track Mission 3 (23.05-30.05)~~
1. Testnet Upgrade - Add liquidity to the new contract (10-30 points)
